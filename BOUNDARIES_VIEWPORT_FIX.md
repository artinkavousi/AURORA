# 🔧 Boundaries Viewport Independence Fix

## ✅ Issue Resolved

Fixed boundaries being deformed by viewport aspect ratio changes (e.g., left panel presence).

## 🐛 Root Cause

The resize handler was updating **all** boundaries with viewport-adaptive gridSize:

```typescript
// BEFORE (Problem):
this.viewportGridSize.set(
  this.baseGridSize.x * Math.max(1, aspect),  // e.g., 96x64x64
  this.baseGridSize.y * Math.max(1, 1 / aspect),
  this.baseGridSize.z
);

// Applied to ALL boundaries (including containers!)
this.boundaries.setGridSize(this.viewportGridSize);  // ❌ Deforms sphere!
```

This caused container boundaries (Sphere, Box, etc.) to become non-uniform (e.g., 96×64×64 instead of 64×64×64), deforming spheres into ellipsoids.

## 🔧 Solution

Introduced **dual grid system**:

### 1. Two Grid Sizes

```typescript
// src/APP.ts
private viewportGridSize = new THREE.Vector3(64, 64, 64);    // Adaptive for viewport/particles
private readonly containerGridSize = new THREE.Vector3(64, 64, 64);  // Fixed uniform for containers
```

### 2. Use Uniform Grid for Containers

```typescript
// src/APP.ts - initializeBoundaries()
this.boundaries = new ParticleBoundaries({
  gridSize: this.containerGridSize.clone(),  // ✅ Uniform 64×64×64
  // ...
});
```

### 3. Conditional Resize Updates

```typescript
// src/APP.ts - setupResizeHandler()
if (this.boundaries && !this.boundaries.isEnabled()) {
  // Viewport mode (NONE): use adaptive gridSize
  this.boundaries.setGridSize(this.viewportGridSize);
}
// Container mode: boundaries keep their uniform containerGridSize (64×64×64)
```

## 📊 Results

| Scenario | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Sphere with panels** | Deformed ellipsoid | ✅ Perfect sphere |
| **Viewport mode** | Adaptive boundaries | ✅ Still adaptive |
| **Container mode** | Stretched by aspect | ✅ Always uniform |
| **Resize handling** | All boundaries updated | ✅ Only viewport updated |

## 🎯 Key Improvements

1. **Independent**: Container boundaries are no longer affected by viewport changes
2. **Uniform**: Spheres stay spherical (64×64×64) regardless of window aspect ratio
3. **Adaptive**: Viewport mode still responds to window resizing as intended
4. **Aligned**: Visual and collision boundaries remain perfectly matched

## 📝 Files Modified

- `src/APP.ts`:
  - Added `containerGridSize` property
  - Updated `initializeBoundaries()` to use containerGridSize
  - Modified `setupResizeHandler()` with conditional gridSize updates

## 🚀 Usage

Boundaries now maintain their shape independently:

```typescript
// Container mode (Sphere, Box, etc.):
// - GridSize remains 64×64×64 (uniform)
// - Not affected by window resize
// - Perfect sphere/cube shape maintained

// Viewport mode (NONE):
// - GridSize adapts to viewport (e.g., 96×64×64 landscape)
// - Responds to window resize
// - Particles stay visible on page
```

## 🎨 Visual Result

- **Sphere boundaries** remain perfectly spherical
- **Box boundaries** maintain cubic proportions
- **Tube boundaries** keep circular cross-section
- **No deformation** from panels, window resize, or viewport changes

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Boundaries are now truly independent of viewport
**Tested**: Sphere maintains shape with left/right panels open
**Performance**: No impact (conditional check is negligible)
