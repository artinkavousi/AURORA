## ✅ Phase 3: Ensemble Choreography (Complete)

### Deliverables

#### 1. Ensemble Choreographer ✅
**File:** `src/AUDIO/kinetic/ensemble-choreographer.ts` (~550 lines)

**Features Implemented:**

**Role Assignment System:**
- ✅ Dynamic particle role assignment (Lead 10%, Support 30%, Ambient 60%)
- ✅ Priority-based scoring using:
  - Distance to camera (closer = higher priority)
  - Particle energy (faster = higher priority)
  - Height position (higher = more prominent)
  - Audio reactivity zones
  - Random variation (prevent static assignments)
- ✅ Role hysteresis (2-second cooldown prevents rapid switching)
- ✅ Smooth role transitions

**Inter-Particle Communication:**
- ✅ Influence signal emission from Lead particles
- ✅ Signal contains:
  - Position and velocity
  - Active gesture and phase
  - Intensity and influence radius
- ✅ Nearest influence detection for Support particles

#### 2. Spatial Composer ✅
**File:** `src/AUDIO/kinetic/spatial-composer.ts` (~450 lines)

**Features Implemented:**

**3 Depth Layers:**
1. **Foreground** (0-40% depth)
   - Fast, sharp motion
   - High treble response
   - Bright, saturated colors
   - Larger particles
   
2. **Midground** (40-80% depth)
   - Main ensemble action
   - Full frequency response
   - Standard appearance
   - Normal particle size
   
3. **Background** (80-100% depth)
   - Slow, atmospheric motion
   - High bass response
   - Desaturated, dimmer colors
   - Smaller particles

**Spatial Modulation:**
- ✅ Camera-aware depth calculation
- ✅ Normalized depth (0=near, 1=far)
- ✅ Layer assignment based on depth
- ✅ Force scaling by layer (Foreground: 1.5x, Midground: 1.0x, Background: 0.6x)
- ✅ Motion speed by layer (Foreground: 1.3x, Midground: 1.0x, Background: 0.7x)
- ✅ Frequency response by layer:
  - Foreground: High treble (1.0), low bass (0.3)
  - Midground: Balanced (0.8-1.0 all)
  - Background: High bass (1.0), low treble (0.2)

**Visual Modulation:**
- ✅ Brightness by depth (1.3x foreground → 0.6x background)
- ✅ Saturation by depth (1.2x foreground → 0.7x background)
- ✅ Scale by depth (1.2x foreground → 0.8x background)
- ✅ Opacity by depth (1.0 foreground → 0.5 background)

**Role-Based Adjustments:**
- ✅ Lead particles: +20% force, +20% speed, +30% brightness, +30% scale
- ✅ Support particles: Default modulation
- ✅ Ambient particles: -30% force, -20% speed, -30% brightness, -30% scale

**Camera-Aware Dynamics:**
- ✅ **Approach/Retreat** forces based on audio (accents = approach, releases = retreat)
- ✅ **Lateral forces** from stereo imaging (balance = left/right motion)
- ✅ **Vertical forces** from tonal register (treble = up, bass = down)
- ✅ Distance-scaled effects (farther particles move more)

**Performance Optimization:**
- ✅ Modulation caching (100ms cache lifetime)
- ✅ Lazy calculation (only when accessed)
- ✅ Cache invalidation on camera/particle changes

**Key Classes:**
- `SpatialComposer` - Main staging system
- `DepthLayer` - Enum (Foreground/Midground/Background)
- `SpatialModulation` - Complete spatial modulation data
- `StagingConfig` - Configurable staging parameters
- `SpatialState` - Complete spatial state

**Validation:**
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ Clean TypeScript compilation
- ⏳ Visual validation (pending integration)

## 🎯 Phase 3 Key Innovations

### 1. **Intelligent Role Assignment**
Particles aren't just randomly assigned roles—the system intelligently prioritizes based on:
- Visibility (camera distance)
- Energy (motion)
- Position (height, proximity)
- Audio reactivity

### 2. **Musical Formation Choreography**
Formations aren't static—they adapt to musical structure:
- Intro → Scattered (sparse start)
- Verse → Flowing (narrative motion)
- Chorus → Clustered (dense, unified)
- Build-up → Spiral (tension building)
- Drop → Radial (explosive expansion)

### 3. **Camera-Aware Composition**
The system understands spatial depth and creates cinematic composition:
- Foreground: Fast, bright, detailed accents
- Midground: Main performance area
- Background: Slow, atmospheric context

### 4. **Dynamic Staging**
Not just depth layers—active camera choreography:
- Particles approach on accents (dramatic)
- Particles retreat on releases (breathing)
- Lateral motion for stereo imaging
- Vertical motion for tonal register
