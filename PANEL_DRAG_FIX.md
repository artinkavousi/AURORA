# ✅ Panel Dragging Fixed - No Boundaries!

## Problem

Control panels were constrained to viewport boundaries and couldn't be moved freely. They were limited by:
- Left edge: `x >= 0`
- Top edge: `y >= 0`
- Right edge: `x <= window.innerWidth - panel.width`
- Bottom edge: `y <= window.innerHeight - panel.height`

This prevented panels from being positioned outside the visible viewport.

## Solution

Removed all viewport boundary constraints from the drag function.

### Code Changes

**Before (Constrained):**
```javascript
const drag = (e: MouseEvent | TouchEvent) => {
  if (!isDragging) return;

  const event = 'touches' in e ? e.touches[0] : e;

  currentX = event.clientX - initialX;
  currentY = event.clientY - initialY;

  // Constrain to viewport ❌
  const maxX = window.innerWidth - container.offsetWidth;
  const maxY = window.innerHeight - container.offsetHeight;

  currentX = Math.max(0, Math.min(currentX, maxX));
  currentY = Math.max(0, Math.min(currentY, maxY));

  container.style.transform = `translate3d(${currentX}px, ${currentY}px, 0)`;
};
```

**After (Free Movement):**
```javascript
const drag = (e: MouseEvent | TouchEvent) => {
  if (!isDragging) return;

  const event = 'touches' in e ? e.touches[0] : e;

  currentX = event.clientX - initialX;
  currentY = event.clientY - initialY;

  // No constraints - move freely anywhere on screen ✅
  container.style.transform = `translate3d(${currentX}px, ${currentY}px, 0)`;
};
```

### What Changed

✅ **Removed**: `Math.max(0, Math.min(currentX, maxX))` constraint  
✅ **Removed**: `Math.max(0, Math.min(currentY, maxY))` constraint  
✅ **Removed**: Viewport boundary calculations  

## Result

✅ **Move Anywhere** - Panels can be positioned anywhere, even outside viewport  
✅ **No Limits** - Negative coordinates allowed  
✅ **Free Positioning** - Can move beyond window edges  
✅ **Full Control** - Complete freedom of movement  

## How It Works Now

### Movement Freedom

| Direction | Before | After |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| **Left** | Stopped at x = 0 | Can go negative (off-screen left) |
| **Right** | Stopped at viewport edge | Can go beyond viewport |
| **Top** | Stopped at y = 0 | Can go negative (off-screen top) |
| **Bottom** | Stopped at viewport edge | Can go beyond viewport |

### Usage

1. **Click and hold** on the panel title bar
2. **Drag** in any direction
3. **Move freely** - no boundaries!
4. Panels can now be:
   - Moved off-screen temporarily
   - Positioned beyond viewport edges
   - Placed at negative coordinates

### Note

If you move a panel completely off-screen and can't find it, you can:
1. **Refresh the page** - Panels will reset to default positions
2. **Use browser zoom** - Zoom out to see off-screen panels
3. **Future enhancement**: Add a "Reset Positions" button

## Files Modified

- ✅ `flow/src/PANEL/dashboard.ts` - Removed viewport constraints from `makeDraggable()`

## No Linter Errors ✅
