## üîç Current System Insights

### Physics & Simulation
- The core simulator is an MLS-MPM pipeline with configurable transfer modes (PIC/FLIP/Hybrid) and support for vorticity, surface tension, sparse grids, and adaptive timesteps, giving us a rich baseline for advanced fluid behaviors.„ÄêF:src/PARTICLESYSTEM/physic/mls-mpm.ts‚Ä†L1-L121„Äë„ÄêF:src/PARTICLESYSTEM/physic/mls-mpm.ts‚Ä†L74-L90„Äë
- Particle buffers already track per-particle materials, color, and lifecycle metadata, which we can leverage for richer material transitions and history-aware effects.„ÄêF:src/PARTICLESYSTEM/physic/mls-mpm.ts‚Ä†L123-L155„Äë

### Boundary System
- The boundary manager supports multiple container shapes, custom meshes, collision modes, and optional visualization, defaulting to a "None/Viewport" mode when disabled.„ÄêF:src/PARTICLESYSTEM/physic/boundaries.ts‚Ä†L1-L186„Äë„ÄêF:src/PARTICLESYSTEM/physic/boundaries.ts‚Ä†L372-L508„Äë
- In "None" mode, collisions fall back to soft viewport clamping; however, audio-reactive behaviors and mesh feedback are skipped, reducing cohesion when users expect sound-driven pulses even without a visible container.„ÄêF:src/PARTICLESYSTEM/physic/boundaries.ts‚Ä†L409-L475„Äë„ÄêF:src/PARTICLESYSTEM/physic/boundaries.ts‚Ä†L748-L788„Äë
- Boundary uniforms are relayed to the MLS-MPM core, so any shape/parameter changes can propagate immediately across the GPU kernels.„ÄêF:src/PARTICLESYSTEM/physic/mls-mpm.ts‚Ä†L1127-L1171„Äë

### Audio Reactivity
- The audio stack includes a robust analyzer (FFT, beat detection, smoothing) and a high-level behavior mapper that can spawn audio-driven force fields, adjust material properties, and expose numerous tuning parameters.„ÄêF:src/AUDIO/soundreactivity.ts‚Ä†L1-L120„Äë„ÄêF:src/AUDIO/audioreactive.ts‚Ä†L1-L200„Äë
- Boundaries only react when visualization is active, leaving a gap between the analyzer output and boundary feedback in minimal UI configurations.„ÄêF:src/PARTICLESYSTEM/physic/boundaries.ts‚Ä†L748-L788„Äë

### Rendering & PostFX
- The rendering layer already blends bloom, radial focus blur, and chromatic aberration with TSL nodes, exposing uniforms for runtime control and custom composition logic.„ÄêF:src/POSTFX/postfx.ts‚Ä†L1-L200„Äë
- We currently rely on fullscreen compositing without scene-aware adaptivity (e.g., camera motion compensation, exposure histogramming), limiting cinematic responsiveness.

## üéØ Upgrade Objectives
1. **Performance & Scale:** Double the stable particle count while keeping latency under 16 ms by leaning on smarter scheduling and data management.
2. **Visual Fidelity:** Introduce cinematic lighting, volumetric cues, and mesh-based particles that reinforce audio and physics states.
3. **Interactivity & UX:** Provide a control surface that feels musical and tactile, with presets, macros, and collaborative states.
4. **Reliability & Debuggability:** Bake in diagnostics, profiling, and automated validation to support rapid iteration.

## üß± Pillar 1 ‚Äî Physics & Systems Enhancements

### 1.1 Hybrid Solver Evolution
- Add FLIP/PIC blending controls per-material to let viscous and gaseous materials diverge in feel without separate kernels.
- Introduce adaptive sub-stepping triggered by beat intensity or particle density spikes to prevent blow-ups during aggressive audio peaks.

### 1.2 Sparse Grid & Scheduling Upgrades
- Promote the existing sparse-grid markers into a full active-cell work queue processed via indirect dispatch. This keeps compute focused where particles live, enabling the 2√ó scale target.
- Implement GPU-side compaction for particles leaving the viewport boundary so we can recycle buffers without CPU stalls.

### 1.3 Material Intelligence
- Use the per-particle lifecycle slots to drive shader morphs (e.g., molten-to-vapor transitions) synchronized with audio bands.
- Add temperature/energy fields tracked alongside density to unlock future features like phase changes or thermal color grading.

### 1.4 Debug & Validation Toolkit
- Build a `SimulationDiagnostic` overlay that renders velocity divergence, cell occupancy heatmaps, and CFL metrics using lightweight compute dispatches.
- Add deterministic replay captures (seed + audio envelope + UI deltas) so we can reproduce issues quickly across devices.

## üõ°Ô∏è Pillar 2 ‚Äî Boundary & Collision Roadmap

### 2.1 Cohesive "None" Mode
- Keep viewport collisions but let the boundary system synthesize a procedural "energy shell" that pulses with bass data, even when meshes are hidden. This maintains audio/physics cohesion without forcing geometry.
- Mirror those pulses into subtle velocity damping or expansion fields so particles still respond physically to the beat.

### 2.2 Audio Reactive Reliability
- When audio reactive mode is enabled, stream analyzer envelopes directly into boundary uniforms so that meshless and mesh modes share a single update path.
- Add hysteresis and smoothing on beat-driven boundary scaling to avoid jitter when FFT noise crosses thresholds.

### 2.3 Advanced Collision Shapes
- Support signed distance field (SDF) collisions for custom meshes by converting OBJ assets into voxelized SDF textures at load time. This expands boundaries beyond current analytic primitives.
- Offer per-face friction/restitution maps for imported meshes to create richer tactile responses.

### 2.4 Boundary Debugging
- Provide a boundary inspector panel that visualizes collision normals, penetration depth histograms, and audio response curves to accelerate tuning.

## üåà Pillar 3 ‚Äî Rendering & Visual Presence

### 3.1 Lighting & Materials
- Introduce clustered lighting with audio-reactive light rigs tied to beat phases, giving spectators visual anchors.
- Add mesh instancing for "hero" particles that promote to ribbon trails or glyphs during crescendos.

### 3.2 PostFX Evolution
- Extend the PostFX composer with exposure adaptation and color grading LUTs to keep brightness consistent across tracks.
- Layer in volumetric fog slices modulated by audio bands to give depth without overwhelming fill rate.

### 3.3 UI & Presentation
- Deploy preset-driven camera choreography and timeline markers so scenes can transition automatically during performances.
- Enable collaborative control surfaces (WebRTC MIDI/OSC bridge) for multi-user jams.

---

## üéõÔ∏è Pillar 4 ‚Äî Tooling, UX, and Quality

### 4.1 Control Center Redesign
- Consolidate physics, audio, and rendering panels into a scene graph inspector with contextual quick actions, macros, and undo/redo.
- Offer "Performance Modes" (Studio, Showcase, Battery Saver) that reconfigure solver resolution, post FX, and UI density in one click.

### 4.2 Observability & Testing
- Integrate GPU timing queries, audio spectrum logging, and boundary event counters into a unified HUD for live profiling.
- Ship automated regression suites that record frame captures + audio envelopes to detect visual/audio drift between commits.

### 4.3 Deployment & Accessibility
- Add progressive enhancement fallbacks (WebGL2 renderer, reduced particle counts) for broader device compatibility.
- Provide customizable color palettes and motion sensitivity toggles to meet accessibility guidelines.
